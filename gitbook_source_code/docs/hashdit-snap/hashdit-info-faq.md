### What does HashDit Snap do?
HashDit Snap aims to protect users by screening transactions before they are executed through Address Poisoning Detection, Transaction, Destination, and URL screening. This include warnings against: 

* Address Poisoning Attacks
* Ponzi Schemes
* Risky Smart Contract Interactions
* Phishing Websites and Addresses
* Scam Websites and Addresses

HashDit Snap also provides clear details about the function and arguments invoked during a smart contract interaction through Function Call insights.

***
### What does HashDit Snap not do?
Currently, HashDit Snap does not support screening during approval calls and signature requests due to the lack of support for these features in MetaMask Snap. However, once MetaMask Snap incorporates these capabilities, we have plans to introduce approval screening against blacklisted addresses and screening for signature requests. Stay tuned for future updates as we enhance the security features of HashDit Snap.

***
### Can false positives happen?
While we aim for accurate risk assessments, false positives can occur. Exercise caution by verifying official URLs on platforms like CoinMarketCap, and confirming legitimacy through social channels. Be cautious of scams; seek multiple confirmations for added security. Your discretion is advised.

***
### Is HashDit Snap mobile compatible?
As of now, Snaps are not compatible with the MetaMask mobile wallet. However, mobile compatibility is on the MetMask roadmap. Once available, we plan on supporting HashDit Snaps on the mobile wallet.

Simply [uinstall](./hashdit-usage-install-uninstall.md#uninstalling-hashdit-Snap) and [install](./hashdit-usage-install-uninstall.md#installing-hashdit-Snap) the Snap and you will be prompted to sign the security message again.
