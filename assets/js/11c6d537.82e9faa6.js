Through repeated operations, the hacker made a profit of $300,000.\nThis hacking incident could have been intercepted by our Guardian strategy. When a hacker tries to profit multiple times by exploiting a logical loophole, the transferred amount triggers the threshold, and the hacked funds would enter a fund protection program. As the hacker's address hits the blacklist, the funds would be retained in the Guardian contract. Any attempts by the hacker to withdraw profits would be nonviable, and the right to manage funds would solely lie with the project's team.\nGuardian strategy can effectively intercept such simple transfer scenario hacks, regardless of how complex the contract vulnerabilities exploited in the attack method are.
